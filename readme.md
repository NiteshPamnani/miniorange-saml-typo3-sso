This is a Typo3 plugin from miniOrange Inc. for Single-Sign-On(SSO) via SAML protocol.

This is continued work from previous plugin with different repo name "typo3-saml-sso". This change in repository name is to match the naming standard of typo3.

So feel free to point out bugs or issues. We also provide a premium plugin with all features enabled. For any query email at info@xecurify.com or visit https://www.miniorange.com/contact.
