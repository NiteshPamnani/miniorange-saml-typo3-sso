This is continued work from previous plugin with different repo name "typo3-saml-sso" by miniOrange. 
This change in repository name is to match the naming standard of typo3. 
Some important bugs are fixed with some UI improvemnts also and the version number is bumped to 1.2.* 

So feel free to point out bugs or issues.
