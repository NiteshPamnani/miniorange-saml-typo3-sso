This is a Typo3 plugin from miniOrange Inc. for Single-Sign-On(SSO) via SAML protocol. 

This is continued work from previous plugin with different repo name "typo3-saml-sso". 
This change in repository name is to match the naming standard of typo3. 

Some bugs are also fixed with some UI improvemnts and the version number is bumped to 1.2.*
